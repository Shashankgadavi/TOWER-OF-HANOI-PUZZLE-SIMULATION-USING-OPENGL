#TOWER OF HANOI PUZZLE SIMULATION:

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.

2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

It allows user to choose number of disc.

It show the time taken to finish the simulation.

The speed of simulation can be increased as well as decrement with keyword interaction. 

There are many views which can be zoom in and zoom out with help of some keys.

This mini-project was done using OpenGL in Visual Studio Platform.
